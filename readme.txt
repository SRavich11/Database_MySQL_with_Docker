____THIS IS AN UPDATE OF THE PREVIOUS PROJECT WITH REDIS SUPPORT_____
* Unzip the folder and then move to the folder with the DockerFile (usually the landing folder). Use the command docker-compose --build -t
* This will turn on the containers which have all the required files. The DockerFile has all the dependencies and the commands to setup redis 
as a container 
* The application will be running on localhost with port 8080
* You can add and view the table contents in the application as explained in the report
